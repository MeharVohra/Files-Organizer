This is a Python script that moves a file to a specified folder based on the file's extension. The script does the following:

Imports the "os" and "shutil" modules.

Takes the file name as an input from the user, removes the quotes from the file name and gets the extension of the file by splitting the file name by the dot.

Defines seven destination folders (dstFile1 to dstFile7) where the file will be moved based on its extension.

Uses an if-elif chain to check the file extension and move the file to the corresponding folder. If the folder does not exist, it is created first using the os.makedirs method. If the file's extension does not match any of the extensions in the if-elif chain, it is moved to the "Other Formats File" folder.

The shutil.move method is used to move the file to the specified folder. The "src" and "dst" parameters are used to specify the source file and the destination folder.

The script has an exception handling mechanism to handle the "FileNotFoundError" error in case the file does not exist.
